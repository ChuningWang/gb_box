# A combined forward/inverse model for Glacier Bay

Of course every oceanopgrapher wants a high resolution, 3D ocean model.

But you don't always get one.

Therefore, a simple model with reduced physics could be helpful to identify the primary processes.

This project is one example to simplify the complex estuarine (fjord) circulation probelm into a box-based transport approximation, aka, box model.

It is still in experimenting stage.

Current version is 0.0.1.
